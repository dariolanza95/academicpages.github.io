I’m a Ph.D. student at Universidad de Zaragoza in Spain. I’m currently working at the intersection between computer graphics and appearance modeling. The goal of my work is to simplify the editing of realistic materials, both data-driven and parametric. My work is supervised by Adrian Jarabo and Belen Masia. I obtained my master’s degree from Univerzita Karlova in Prague, Czech Republic. During my master thesis, I experimented with fluid simulation and terrain erosion, under the supervision of Alexander Wilkie. Prior to that experience, I took my bachelor’s degree at Politecnico di Torino in Italy. My non-academic interests include drawing and using 3D software tools to generate pretty images just for the sake of it! I also enjoy having a beer with friends.
