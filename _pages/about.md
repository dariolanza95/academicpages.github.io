I am a Ph.D. student at Universidad de Zaragoza in Spain, working at the [Graphics and Imaging Lab](https://graphics.unizar.es/) and part of the [PRIME ITN](https://prime-itn.eu/) . I am currently working at the intersection between computer graphics and appearance modeling. The goal of my work is to simplify the editing of realistic materials, both data-driven and parametric. My work is supervised by [Adrian Jarabo](http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~ajarabo/) and [Belen Masia](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~bmasia/). I obtained my master’s degree from Univerzita Karlova in Prague, Czech Republic. During my master thesis, I experimented with fluid simulation and terrain erosion, under the supervision of [Alexander Wilkie](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/members/wilkie/). Prior to that experience, I took my bachelor’s degree at Politecnico di Torino in Italy. My non-academic interests include drawing and using 3D software tools to generate pretty images just for the sake of it! I also enjoy having a beer with friends.
