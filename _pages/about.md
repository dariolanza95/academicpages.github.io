Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate at Universidad de Zaragoza in Spain, working at the [Graphics and Imaging Lab](https://graphics.unizar.es/) and part of the [PRIME ITN](https://prime-itn.eu/). I recently submitted my Ph.D. thesis, "Perception, Editing, and Modeling of Volumetric Media." While awaiting the dates for my defense, I am actively **seeking job opportunities**. My research focuses on advancing the representation of volumetric materials—such as skin, cosmetics, and feathers—from both mathematical and perceptual perspectives.
 My work has been supervised by Prof. [Adrian Jarabo](http://giga.cps.unizar.es/~ajarabo/) and Prof. [Belen Masia](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~bmasia/). I obtained my master’s degree from Univerzita Karlova in Prague, Czech Republic. During my master thesis, I experimented with fluid simulation and terrain erosion, under the supervision of Prof. [Alexander Wilkie](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/members/wilkie/). Prior to that experience, I took my bachelor’s degree at Politecnico di Torino in Italy. My non-academic interests include drawing with pen and pencils, climbing and reading (possibly something not technical).
